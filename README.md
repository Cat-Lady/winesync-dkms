# winesync-dkms
Winesync/fastsync DKMS kernel module.
---
Allows to build the winesync (fastsync):
https://repo.or.cz/linux/zf.git/shortlog/refs/heads/winesync

...kernel-side part as external module, handled by DKMS.

---
Based on openglfreak's work from here:
https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/winesync-dkms/

...just edited to work on non-makepkg distros, like Debian, Gentoo, Ubuntu, etc. Basically, anywhere where DKMS is available (and kernel version used is recent enough for it to compile sucessfuly).
